Hi, I am Siyuan Mu, currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at [Sichuan Agricultural University]([四川农业大学](https://www.sicau.edu.cn/)). In the second semester of my sophomore year, I joined the Deep Visual Agriculture Lab, where the research focuses on computer vision applications in agriculture and livestock farming. During my junior year, I served as a research assistant for [Dr.Sen Lin]([About me - Sen Lin’s Homepage](https://slin70.github.io/)), an assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department of the University of Houston]([Department of Computer Science](https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/)). My research interests lie in continual learning, multimodal, and MoE(mixture of experts). I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs for the Fall 2026 intake. If you are interested in potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me.
