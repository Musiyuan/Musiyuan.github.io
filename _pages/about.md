Hello, I am Mu Siyuan, currently a senior undergraduate student majoring in Information and Computing Science at [Sichuan Agricultural University]([四川农业大学](https://www.sicau.edu.cn/)). In the second semester of my sophomore year, I joined the Deep Visual Agriculture Lab, where the research focuses on computer vision applications in agriculture and livestock farming. During my junior year, I served as a research assistant for [Dr.Sen Lin]([About me - Sen Lin’s Homepage](https://slin70.github.io/)), an assistant professor at the University of Houston. My research interests lie in continual learning, multimodal learning, and mixture of experts. I am currently applying for Ph.D. programs for the Fall 2026 intake. You can find my CV via the navigation bar above. If you are interested in potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me.
