The CFN leverages a unique combination of diffusion models and ControlNet to achieve an optimal balance between semantic extraction and detail preservation in image fusion tasks. Unlike traditional methods, CFN employs a multi-step progressive generation process, where control mechanisms are integrated at each step to retain fine details while enhancing the semantic coherence of the generated image. This approach ensures that the model captures both high-level semantic features and low-level details, making it particularly effective for tasks like emoji fusion, where human intuition and visual accuracy are crucial. The simplicity and efficiency of CFN, combined with its ability to handle complex fusion tasks, highlight its effectiveness and practicality in image generation and processing applications.
